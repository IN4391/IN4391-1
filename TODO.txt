Make GSes send message to other GSes to update their view [done]

Make RMs choose one of GSes at random [done]

Load balancing between Gses [done]

--------------------------------

Make sending messages between GSes more efficient

RM --> GS
Try out round robin versus random

In

Try and spawn different processes with ProcessBuilder for use on the DAS-4

Think of fault tolerance mechanisms

Crash is detected by a message from a resource manager, who couldn't connect to a GS node.

GS queues will not be replicated, any jobs lost during a crash must be issued again after detection. Detection is done by a client asking a gridscheduler whether any gridscheduler has this job in his queue.
